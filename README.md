# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Detection-System
This project implements a machine learning-based classification system to distinguish between rocks and mines using sonar signal data. The system leverages a supervised learning model trained on the UCI Sonar dataset to analyze sonar signal returns bounced off objects in the ocean.

Each instance in the dataset contains 60 numeric attributes representing the energy within a particular frequency band, and the goal is to predict whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

âœ… Features
Preprocessing of sonar data for optimal model performance

Model training using popular machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluation metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Real-time prediction capability with user input

Clean and modular Python implementation

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python

scikit-learn

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if included)

Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models
This project supports multiple classification algorithms, allowing comparison and selection of the best-performing model. Default model: Logistic Regression.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Load and preprocess the sonar dataset

Split data into training and test sets

Train a machine learning classifier

Evaluate model performance

Accept new sonar inputs and predict if the object is a mine or rock
